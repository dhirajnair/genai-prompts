# SkyPulse - Features & User Stories

## MVP Features

### Feature 1: Object Input
- **Name**: Bulk Object ID Input
- **Description**: Accept a list of astronomical object identifiers (Gaia IDs, TIC IDs, etc.) via text input or file upload
- **User Story**: As a scientist, I want to input multiple object IDs at once so that I can quickly gather context for my entire dataset
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Accept comma/newline separated IDs in text area
  - Accept CSV file upload with ID column
  - Auto-detect ID type (Gaia, TIC, etc.)
  - Validate IDs before processing
  - Support batch sizes up to 100 objects

### Feature 2: Multi-Source Data Retrieval
- **Name**: External Database Query Engine
- **Description**: Query multiple astronomical databases and APIs to retrieve metadata for each object
- **User Story**: As a scientist, I want the app to automatically query all relevant databases so that I don't have to manually search each source
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Query SIMBAD for basic object info and cross-IDs
  - Query VizieR for catalog data
  - Query NASA Exoplanet Archive (for exoplanet candidates)
  - Query MAST (for TESS/Kepler data)
  - Handle API rate limits gracefully
  - Show progress during retrieval

### Feature 3: Data Consolidation
- **Name**: Metadata Normalization
- **Description**: Merge and normalize data from multiple sources into a unified structure
- **User Story**: As a scientist, I want data from different sources merged intelligently so that I see one coherent view per object
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Resolve conflicting values (e.g., different RA/Dec precision)
  - Standardize units (magnitudes, coordinates, etc.)
  - Flag data source for each parameter
  - Handle missing data gracefully

### Feature 4: Object Summary Page
- **Name**: Integrated Object Summary
- **Description**: Display a structured summary page for each object with text description and key parameters
- **User Story**: As a scientist, I want a clear summary page per object so that I can quickly understand what's known about it
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Show object name and all known aliases
  - Display coordinates (RA, Dec) with sky map preview
  - List key parameters (magnitude, spectral type, distance, etc.)
  - Show object classification and flags
  - Display data source citations
  - Generate natural language summary paragraph

### Feature 5: Results Export
- **Name**: Export & Download
- **Description**: Export consolidated results in various formats
- **User Story**: As a scientist, I want to export the gathered data so that I can use it in my analysis pipeline
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Export as CSV
  - Export as JSON
  - Export individual object summaries as PDF
  - Bulk export all objects

## Future Features (Post-MVP)
- Light curve visualization from TESS/Kepler
- Integration with ADS for literature references
- AI-generated scientific context paragraphs
- Object comparison view
- Saved searches and object collections
- API access for pipeline integration
- Custom database source configuration

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Single Object Lookup
1. User enters single object ID in search box
2. System validates and detects ID type
3. System queries external databases (shows progress)
4. Summary page displays with all gathered data
5. User can export or copy data

### Flow 2: Batch Processing
1. User uploads CSV or pastes multiple IDs
2. System validates all IDs, shows any errors
3. User confirms and starts batch processing
4. Progress bar shows completion status
5. Results list shows all processed objects
6. User clicks any object to view summary
7. User can bulk export all results

### Flow 3: Review & Export
1. User views object summary page
2. User reviews key parameters and sources
3. User clicks export button
4. User selects format (CSV/JSON/PDF)
5. Download initiates
