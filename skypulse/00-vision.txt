Our scientific pipelines process very large astronomical time-series datasets and identify objects of interest (stars, exoplanet candidates, variable sources, etc.). We now want to build an app "skypulse" , that automatically gathers background information about each object and produces an integrated summary.

You can think of this as an intelligent “context engine” that helps scientists quickly understand what is already known about an object before performing deeper analysis.

Specifically, this layer should be able to:


Take as input a list of object identifiers (e.g., Gaia IDs, TIC IDs).

Query multiple external data sources (such as public astronomical databases or APIs).

Consolidate and normalize the retrieved metadata into a unified structure.

Generate a structured summary page per object (text + key parameters).
