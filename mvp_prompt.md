use specs in @specs  to create an MVP. I must be able to run this locally
Where there are questions make reasonable assumptions and update the question with the assumption made as "default"
Whereever you are unable to make an assumption and and answer is "required" to be mvp/production/deployment ready, create a must_have.md which lists the questions

Be precise and concise
Use best practices.
No compromise on security , standards and best practices
